***Working diary/notes***
Sunday, Apr 23, Joel:
    - Main setup for google Oauth complete. 
    - Navbar initial setup complete with logos and basic formatting.
        - Home/Google image only rendering on index page. This needs fixed.
    - Commented out existing userSchema due to it having it's own model.

    - REVIEWS:
        - Added review setup to show page.(not complete!!!)
        - Updated reviewSchema for user centric functionality.
        - It seems there is no server response currently when trying to submit review.
        - at 2 hour mark of oAuth video.

    - EDIT:
        - Currently, you can leave the edit fields blank and then it "disappers" from show page. Needs corrected so that each filed is required.
